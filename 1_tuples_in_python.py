#Tuple is a collection of Python objects much like a list. 
#The sequence of values stored in a tuple can be of any type, and they are indexed by integers. 

#Values of a tuple are syntactically separated by ‘commas’. 
#Although it is not necessary, it is more common to define a tuple by closing the sequence of values in parentheses. 
#This helps in understanding the Python tuples more easily.

#Creating an empty Tuple
Tuple1 = ()
print("Initial empty Tuple: ")
print (Tuple1)

#Creating a Tuple
#with the use of string
Tuple1 = ('Geeks', 'For')
print("\nTuple with the use of String: ")
print(Tuple1)
